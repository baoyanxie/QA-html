            <h3>Do you consider yourself more of a designer or developer (or something else, other answers are acceptable)?</h3>
            <p>I would consider myself more of a designer because i like creating things and i found my passion and confidence for design.</p>
            
            <h3>What are you most interested in learning in this class?</h3>
         	<p>In order to be proficient, I'm most interested in learning more professional coding methods to make my web design as perfect as possible.
         	   For instance, I would like to learn css and Javascript in this class.</p>
	
	        <h3>What is good design?</h3>
        	<p>In my view, I think a good design should be creative and fulfill its purpose, well organized, has a nice layout, provides useful information,and looks good.</p>
	
        	<h3>What is good web design?</h3>
          	<p>A good web design should be simple that the structure is easy to follow and it is functional. 
          	Also, a good web design should have its particular focus which can catch users' attentions and gives lots of details for users.
          	It is aesthetic with a nice scheme and gives users great visual experience. 
          	All design elements have to be consistent making everything match, such as heading sizes, font choices, photo choices, button styles,
          	spacing,coloring, and illustration styles.</p>
	
	        <h3>What are the good examples of conference/event web sites? Answer by listing at least two sites including each URL and why you chose the site.</h3>
	        <p><a href="http://2012.inspireconf.com/">http://2012.inspireconf.com/</a><br>
               First of all, i like the cute drawing. The colors are bright and soft. My eyes are confortable with this nice color combination. 
               The purpose is clear that i can get the idea immediately. It provides useful information about the craftsmanship event 
               like the details about the event, the introduction of the workshops and sponsors, and the history of its location. 
               All of these are necessary explanations. Moreover, the structure is simple. While i'm moving down of the page, it is easy to identify 
               the change of topics with different colors and designs. Overall, this web design is successful.</p>

               This web site looks clean that directly points out everything in one page. The layout is basic, but it is useful. 
               It has a good color choice;use active colors. The purpose of the page is clear and the information is detailed with good explanations. 
               In this page, the agenda is full of text. Even though it doesn't attach any photos, it has concordant space between each scheduel and the 
               type is the same. Also, the primary and secondary information are marked by different colors. The agenda doesn't look disordered. 
               I would like to view a web site like this because everything is straightforward and it is convenient to use just by scrolling up and down.</p>
